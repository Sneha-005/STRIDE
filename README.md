## Features
- **Step Tracking**: Tracks daily steps using Android's sensor framework and provides insights into step count trends.
- **Daily Reset**: Automatically resets step counts at a scheduled time using `AlarmManager`.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes Dagger Hilt for efficient dependency management and code reusability.
- **Data Persistence**: Implements Room Database and DataStore for secure and efficient data storage.
- **Permissions Handling**: Manages runtime permissions with Accompanist Permissions library.
- **Drag And Drop**: Allow user to move a block on the screen.
- **Exercise Recommendation**: Recommends exercise according to the user requirement(Loss Weight, Muscle Gain, Yoga and Meditation)
- **Bottom Sheet Navigation**: User can navigate to all exercises and workout plans.

## Architecture
The app employs a modular architecture that integrates various modern Android development components and best practices to ensure scalability, maintainability, and high performance.

**Components**

1. **User Interface**
- *RecyclerView*: Developed 10+ dynamic and efficient lists using RecyclerView, significantly enhancing UI responsiveness and user experience.
- *Fragments & Activities*: Structured UI components to manage different sections of the app seamlessly.

2. **Data Management**
- *Retrofit*: Integrated APIs with Retrofit for seamless data exchange between the app and backend services.
- *Glide*: Utilized Glide to efficiently process and load images from the server.
- *DataStore*: Implemented a secure OTP-based Two-Factor Authentication system with access and refresh token management using DataStore.
- *Room Db*: 

3. **Authentication & Security**
- *Authentication (OTP)*: Ensured secure user authentication with OTP-based verification.
- *Token Management*: Managed access and refresh tokens securely using DataStore.
- *Oauth2*: Integrated OAuth2 for seamless authentication.  

4. **Asynchronous Operations**
- *Kotlin Coroutines*: Optimized asynchronous operations by incorporating Kotlin Coroutines for managing background tasks, ensuring smooth and responsive user experiences.

5**State Management**
- *ViewModel*: Utilized ViewModel to manage data for RecyclerView adapters, enabling efficient handling of dynamic lists and minimizing redundant API calls.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Programming language
- **Compose**: UI Toolkit
- **Room DB**: Local database storage
- **Retrofit**: HTTP client for API calls
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming
- **Navigation Component**: Handling navigation within the app
- **Nested Navigation**: Managing multiple levels of navigation
- **LiveData**: Data lifecycle-aware components

## Dependencies
- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern UI toolkit for building native Android UIs declaratively.
- **Dagger Hilt**: A dependency injection library for Android that simplifies dependency management and promotes code reusability.
- **Alarm Manager**: A system service for scheduling and executing tasks at specific times.
- **Room Database**: A persistence library for Android that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
